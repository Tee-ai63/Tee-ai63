## Hi I'm Tess 👋

I hold a degree in Economics and Finance and a C.P.A intermediate level certification. My background in finance has given me a strong foundation in analysis and problem solving and now I,m expanding into the world of **data science**
I've recently started learning **Python** and data-analysis tools and I'm excited about combining my finance knowledge with technical skills to uncover insights and create real impacts. This space is where I'll share my projects and track my learning journey.
